# ðŸ”¤ Task 2 â€“ ABCD Triangle Pattern Generator

Welcome to **Task 2** of the **5.2xGit Open Source Contribution Event**!

This repository contains a **Python-based ABCD Triangle Pattern Generator**. It prints a triangle of sequential alphabet characters (A, AB, ABC, ...) based on the number of rows entered by the user.

It's a great starting point for beginners to understand loops, character encoding, and string formatting in Pythonâ€”and a perfect place to start contributing to open source!
